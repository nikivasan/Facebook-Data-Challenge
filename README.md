# Facebook Data Challenge
This repo holds the presentation and R markdown workbook that contains my final pitch for the 2021 Facebook Data Challenge. We are asked to consider a *hypothetical* world in which Facebook is trying to successfully enter the video entertainment streaming industry through a new product called 'Zuckflix'. 

The prompt is stated below: 
> Make a recommendation for what type of content we should have on 'Zuckflix'. In addition to your overall recommendation, pick a country and make a recommendation for the type of content we should have for that country in particular.

To create my recommendation, I first imported the data into a **PostgreSQL** database so that I could clean and manipulate the data appropriately. I then exported the results of the relevant queries into **R** to get a rough sense of how to visualize the outputs I desired (this was an iterative process). Once I finalized my thought process, I used **Tableau** to create polished versions of my visualizations.
